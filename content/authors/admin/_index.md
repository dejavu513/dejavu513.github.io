## About Me

PhD candidate in computational statistics focusing on the development of Monte Carlo methods, particularly Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). My research centres on efficient sampling algorithms for Bayesian inverse problems, surrogate modelling, and rare event estimation.
