abstract: Computer models enable the study of complex systems and are extensively
  used in fields such as physics, engineering, and biology. History Matching (HM)
  is a statistical calibration method that accounts for various sources of uncertainty
  to update model parameters and align output with observed data. By iteratively excluding
  regions of the parameter space unlikely to yield plausible outputs, HM identifies
  and samples from the so-called non-implausible domain. However, a limitation of
  HM is that it does not yield full Bayesian posterior distributions for model parameters.
  Moreover, HM requires re-execution from scratch when new data is observed, lacking
  the ability to leverage prior results. To address these limitations, we propose
  integrating sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods with HM to achieve full Bayesian
  posterior distributions for sequential calibration. The SMC framework offers a flexible
  and computationally efficient means to update previously constructed distributions
  as new data becomes available. This approach is demonstrated using an engineering
  example and a cardio-respiratory case study with sequential data. Our results show
  that small perturbations to the posterior distributions can be effectively learned
  sequentially by updating computed posterior distributions through the SMC framework,
  thereby enabling dynamic and efficient model updating for evolving data streams.
